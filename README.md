The objective of this project is to showcase my personal portfolio, highlighting my skills, projects, and experience. The website serves as an online resume and a platform for potential employers and collaborators to learn more about me.

## Design Explanation

- **Home:** Introduction and a brief summary of who I am.
- **About:** Detailed information about my background, education, and interests.
- **Projects:** Showcase of my completed projects with descriptions and links.
